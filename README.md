# Virtual Document Scanner

Unlock the future of document handling with our cutting-edge Virtual Document Scanner! This project utilizes the power of OpenCV to transform your everyday webcam into a high-tech document scanner. Imagine effortlessly digitizing your important papers, receipts, or sketches in real-time, right from your desk.

# Features:
- **Real-Time Document Detection**: Harnessing advanced image processing techniques, our scanner instantly identifies the largest document in the frame.
- **Perspective Transformation**: No more awkward angles! Our algorithm warps the perspective, giving you a perfect top-down view of your document.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work smoothly with any webcam, making it incredibly versatile and easy to use.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: See the magic happen with our side-by-side image display, showing both the original and the processed, warp-corrected document.

# How It Works:
1. **Capture**: The webcam captures video frames, setting the stage for real-time document scanning.
2. **Preprocess**: Frames are converted to grayscale, blurred, and processed to highlight edges and contours.
3. **Detect**: The largest quadrilateral contour is detected, assumed to be your document.
4. **Transform**: Using perspective transformation, the document is warped to a bird's-eye view, making it perfectly readable and ready for any digital use.
5. **Display**: Watch the transformation live with our intuitive image stacking, showcasing the raw and processed images side by side.

This project isn't just about scanning; it's about revolutionizing how you interact with physical documents in a digital age. Dive into the code and experience the future of document management!
